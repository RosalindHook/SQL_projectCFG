# SQL_projectCFG

## Introduction
1. My final project for my Kickstarter course with Code First Girls (CFG).

2. The essential points that need to be met by this project are as follows:

a) Create a relational DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables
b) Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables
c) Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way
d) In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
e) Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
f) Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown

3. The project must also include 2-3 'advanced options' from the following list:
a) In your database, create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs
b) In your database, create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs
c) In your database, create an event and demonstrate how it runs
d) Create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that uses the view to
produce a logically arranged result set for analysis.
e) Prepare an example query with group by and having to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis

## Project information
4. My project is designed to track and monitor the contents of my kitchen.

5. It creates six tables: Table_fruit_basket, Table_fridge_contents, Table_freezer_contents, Table_larder_contents, Table_vegcupboard_contents, and Table_fridge_contents. It inserts data into each of the tables with relevant records.

6. It sets the primary key constraint on the ID column of each table to ensure uniqueness. It establishes foreign key relationships between the Table_fridge_contents table and the other four tables: Table_fruit_basket, Table_freezer_contents, Table_larder_contents, and Table_vegcupboard_contents. These foreign key constraints will maintain referential integrity between the related tables.
